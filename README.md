- Smoking status correlation with insurance costs
- BMI category influence on medical expenses
- Regional variations in healthcare charges
- Gender-based analysis of medical costs

## Technical Highlights
- Use of temporary tables for data manipulation
- Advanced SQL techniques including window functions
- Statistical calculations (correlation, percentiles)
- Data binning and categorization

## Data Source
The analysis is performed on a dataset containing information about medical insurance charges and various demographic factors.

## Tools Used
- SQL (BigQuery syntax)
- Markdown for documentation

## Findings
Key findings include the significant impact of smoking on insurance costs, correlation between BMI and charges, and regional differences in medical expenses.

## Future Work
Potential areas for expansion include predictive modeling of insurance costs and more detailed analysis of outlier cases.
